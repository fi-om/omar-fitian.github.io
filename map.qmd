To create this map, I used Minnesota's Exempt Organizations Business Master File (EO BMF) from the IRS. Using the addresses in the dataset, I retrieved their coordinates to map them. Geocoding thousands of addresses is computationally expensive, hence a sample of 100 nonprofits was selected for demonstration purposes.

# Next Steps

- Add more details to the popups, like hours of operation and contact details.

- Graph the predicted risk of nonprofit closure.

- Enable users to filter nonprofits by type of services offered.

- Add county/city level mapping.
