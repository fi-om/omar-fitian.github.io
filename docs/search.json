Geocoding thousands of addresses is computationally expensive, hence a sample of 100 nonprofits was selected for demonstration purposes.\n\n\n\nNext Steps\n\nAdd more details to the popups, like hours of operation and contact details.\nGraph the predicted risk of nonprofit closure.\nEnable users to filter nonprofits by type of services offered.\nAdd county/city level mapping."

This will be possible with access to the specialized data from DEED.\nDevelop machine learning models to predict nonprofit financial stability and risk of closure.\nPerform spatial analysis to identify clustering, dispersion, or geographic risk patterns.\nCompare findings to existing research on nonprofit sector trends and states with similar demographic and economic profiles."
