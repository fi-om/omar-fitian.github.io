    "text": "From the plot, we can see that there is a significant difference in the number of shelters and housing for people experiencing homelessness between states. California seems to have eight times more homeless housing projects than the national average. Minnesota is one of the few Midwestern states who are above the national average. However, this map does not tell the whole story, as California has the highest homeless population in the country. However, this plot can give insight but must be viewed in a larger context. One must also take into account the homeless per capita numbers as well as population density. It would be interesting to calculate the Moran’s I of the number of missions per homeless population."

While the COVID pandemic had a significant impact on the number of encampments in the city, the data is helpful in understanding relatively high areas of homelessness in the city. It is clear that Manhattan has the highest number of reported encampments, so let’s zoom in on it.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that some neighborhoods have had many reports of camps and some none at all. If we aggregate the data we will have a better time visually assessing any spatial autocorrelation.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that many community districts in Manhattan have had little to no reports of encampments, while others have a concentrated number. We can better visualise the data if we log the number of encampments.\n\n\n\n\n\nMuch better, we can better visually assess the distribution of reported encampments in the community districts.\nFrom here, we can calculate the Moran’s I which is a statistical test that measures the spatial autocorrelation of an aggregate variable.\n\n\n\n    Monte-Carlo simulation of Moran I\n\ndata:  mn_sf$n \nweights: mn_nbw  \nnumber of simulations + 1: 1000 \n\nstatistic = -0.013353, observed rank = 701, p-value = 0.299\nalternative hypothesis: greater\n\n\n\\(H_O\\): No spatial autocorrelation, I is close to 0\n\\(H_A\\): Spatial autocorrelation, I \\(\\neq\\) 0.\nWith a Moran’s I of -0.013, we observe a weak negative spatial autocorrelation. However, as the p-value of 0.299 is relatively large, we fail to reject the null hypothesis; the number of reported homeless encampments is not spatially autocorrelated in Manhattan community districts as per this data and our analysis. This could be due to many factors, the lack of robust data on homelessness. Temporal bias could also be an issue, as the data is spread out over four years. Aggregate bias could also have an effect on the results; analysis of point-pattern data using K-cross analyses would have been more appropriate."
